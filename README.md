MifiMonitor
===========

Chrome extension for Mifi Monitoring

This Chrome Extension was developed after frustruation with the built web status screen on my Mifi4620LE Jetpack from Verizon

Install it, and when connected to a Mifi, you will track sessions and have a bandwidth graph!

No password required: This extension is read only, and cannot make changes to your configuration. It only reads status.

This has only been tested on  Mifi4620LE, and is not confimed to work on any other device. If you have others, please test and let me know!
